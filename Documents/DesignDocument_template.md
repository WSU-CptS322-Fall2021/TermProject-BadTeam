# 1. Introduction

The over arching goal of this design document is not only to promote organization and communication between developers but with stakeholders as well, in a manor that is easy to understand regardless of background. Within the design process, gaining the stakeholder's approval - Professor Ay, and TAs - for the design implementation plans is crucial, using a design document helps clearly illustrate the thoughts and goals that the developers have for the project in order to fulfill the needs of the user and the goals of the business. Having a design document also serves as a universal design baseline for team members and allows for isolated and collaborative member(s) to align around the same goals.

Our project, Poly type, is an interactive typing challenge application that allows for players to participate in challenges that hosts create. For players, they can enter a room code and username to join a typing challenge, participate in the pre-established challenges, and view their typing results (words per minutes, incorrect characters, rank).  For hosts, they can log in to their account and access their challenges (create, delete, modify, publish, review results). Our goal is to create a fun, easy to use, and collaborative way to learn and practice typing skills.

# 2.	Architectural and Component-level Design
## 2.1 System Structure

**UML Component Diagram:**

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/UMLComponentDiagram.png)

**View:** The View handles displaying information and UI elements to the user, takes any input from the user, and conveys the given inputs and outputs to Controller. The View is dependent on the Controller for authenticating hosts and connecting players to open challenges (Host management to Host Manager, and Challenge Participation to Challenge Manager respectively).

**Controller:** The Controller provides a layer of separation between the front end and the back end, handles complex business logic for the functionalities of the application, and facilitates communication between the View and the Model. The Controller is dependent on the Model for providing the data for authenticating hosts, accurately populating the Host's list of challenges, and displaying the prompts of an open challenge.

**Model:** The Model stores raw data for hosts, challenges, prompts, and results, as well as handles database operations.

**Rationale:** We chose to use MVC in order to create a clear distinction between the front end (View) and the back end (Model) to decrease coupling. Only the Controller has access to the Model so if the View needs data from the Model it must request it from the Controller. This architecture naturally groups elements that are similar in functionality together - for example, all the .html files for the website are contained within the View system - which encourages and enhances cohesion. Additionally, it allows us to easily update or modify the View without needing to change the Model. As illustrated in the UML component diagram, we create a distinction between the hosts and the players, where the host must be authenticated to access any of the internal data for their account and challenges, whereas the player (Challenge Participation) is only allowed to access the public published challenges. This design creates a layer of security for internal data from unauthenticated users, as well as reduces coupling and enables easier code maintenance.

## 2.2 Subsystem Design 

### 2.2.1 Model

The model defines the schema for our database and the 'plain old python objects' we are going to be using throughout our application.
In our database we are going to have 4 main tables:

#### Host

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Id** | Primary key for the host entry |
| **Username** | Username that is associated with the host (used for logging in) |
| **PasswordHash** | Password hash that is associated with the host (also used for logging in) | 
| **Challenges** | Relationship between a host and the challenges associated with their account</br>One to many relationship (1 -> *) | 

#### Challenge

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Id** | Primary key for the challenge entry |
| **HostId** | Foreign key that links a challenge back to its host |
| **Title** | Name/title that is associated with a challenge |
| **JoinCode** | 6 character alpha-numeric code that is going to be used as the way for a challenger to join a specific challenge  |
| **Prompts** | Relationship between a challenge and the prompts associated with that specific challenge </br> One to many relationship, at least one prompt is required (1 -> 1*)|
| **Results** |Relationship between a challenge and the results of all of the challengers that have taken this specific challenge</br> One to many relationship (1 -> *)|
| **Open** | Boolean value that stores whether or not the challenge is able to be taken currently |

#### Prompt

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Id** | Primary key for the prompt entry |
| **ChallengeId** | Foreign key that links a prompt back to its challenge |
| **Text** | Text that is associated with a given prompt</br>This is what a challenger will actually be typing out when they are participating in a challenge |

#### Result

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| **Id** | Primary key for the result entry |
| **ChallengeId** | Foreign key that links a result back to its challenge |
| **Challenger** | Username of challenger who took the challenge linked to this result |
| **ElapsedTime** | Total elapsed time that it took for the challenger to complete all prompts in the linked challenge |
| **Wpm** | The words per minute that results from the user typing, this is calculated by (correct / 5) / total minutes |
| **Correct** | Total number of correct characters that the challenger typed while completing all prompts in the linked challenge |
| **Incorrect** | Total number of incorrect characters that the challenger typed while completing all prompts in the linked challenge |
| **Extra** | Total number of extra characters that the challenger typed while completing all prompts in the linked challenge |

### 2.2.2 Controller

Initialize App:
  * Creates an Instance of a Flask Web Server 
  * Configures the connection between our code and our MVC file structure
  * In the instance in which a database is not already created, initializes an empty database
  * Registers the blueprints for the routes we are using to divide up and organize our application

Host Manager:

The Host Manager is a sub handler within the controller that facilitates authenticated actions that are restricted to host users. It enables secure interaction between the View and the Model for Host Log In and General Host operations. 

  * Directs the flow of information between the Host UI and the Host related entities in the database
  * Manages the numerous host-only functionalities
    * [Create Challenge](#create-challenge-entry)
    * [Edit Challenge](#edit-challenge-entry)
    * [Delete Challenge](#delete-challenge-entry)
    * [Start Challenge](#open-challenge-entry)
    * [End Challenge](#close-challenge-entry)
    * [Edit Account Information](#edit-host-entry)
    * [Logout](#logout-entry)
  * This component interacts with...
    * Host Management (UI), this provides the relevant interfaces required
    * Host Log In Operations, this component relies upon this system to make sure that the correct user is able to log in
    * Host Operations, this component relies upon this system to access the relevant operations related to a given host

Challenge Manager:

The Challenge Manager is the other major sub handler within the Controller which handles unauthenticated user interaction.  It also facilitates the primary typing challenge functionality for the program. 

  * Directs the flow of information between the Challenger UI and the Challenger related entities in the database
  * Manages the functionalities only given to challengers (non-logged in users)
    * [Login](#index-entry)
    * [Register](#index-entry)
    * [Join Challenge](#index-entry)
    * [Participate in Challenge](#take-challenge-entry)
    * [View Challenger Specific Results](#result-challenger-entry)
  * This component interacts with...
    * Challenge Participation (UI), this component provides the relevant interfaces required
    * Challenge Operations, this component relies upon the information and functionalities found within this given system

|   | Methods           | URL Path   | Description  |
|:--|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|
|<h5 id="create-challenge-entry">1.</h5> | GET, POST | /create_challenge | GET: This will load an empty form for a host to then fill out with all of the necessary info to create a *challenge*, which they can then press the submit button to post the form.</br>POST: This is trigged on the completion of the create challenge form. After submitted a new *challenge* will be entered into the database with the current *host* associated. Additionally, during this process a random join code will be generated and given to the *challenge* |
|<h5 id="take-challenge-entry">2.</h5> | GET, POST | /take_challenge/&lt;guid&gt; | GET: This will be triggered after the *challenger* enters in a valid join code for a *challenge*. This page will then load with the given *challenge* that the *challenger* is participating in with its associated *prompts* being displayed for the *challenger* to type</br>POST: This post is going to collect the data associated with the *challenger* as they are participating in the *challenge*. After the *challenger* finishes typing in the final *prompt* a collection of information (elapsed time, # of correct characters, # of incorrect characters) will be sent to the result route to create a result.</br>Guid: This guid is a random identifier assigned to a *challenger* when they initially try to participate in a *challenge*. This guid will be used to access relevant information throughout the session. |
|<h5 id="index-entry">3.</h5> | GET, POST | /index | GET: Load the JoinChallenge form. This is the form a *challenger* can enter their username and join code into to then join a *challenge*</br>POST: After a JoinChallenge form is posted the *challenger* is routed to the take challenge route where they can participate in their *challenge*.</br>GET: Load the Login form. This is the form a *host* can enter their username and password into to login to their account.</br>POST: After a Login form is posted, assuming valid login information, the *host* will be redirected to their view challenges route where they can perform a myriad of *host* related operations.</br>GET: Load the registration form. This is the form where someone who does not have an account can enter a username and password to then create a *host* account.</br>POST: After a Registration form is posted, assuming valid input, a new *host* will be created and the newly created account will be redirected to the view challenges route similar to the login.</br>*IMPORTANT NOTES:* We intentionally include login and registration in this route to help achieve our design philosophy of reducing page redirects. This is not an attempt to reduce the overall work of routing our application. It should be noted that this change increased the overall complexity of our main page as we still needed to make it look nice</br>Additionally, there was concerns in our original design document about the ability to differentiate between the separate use cases in our index route. We are able to accomplish this by filtering our post request to check which form was submitted and then provide the correct functionality depending on what form was submitted. Lastly, our GET request in our index route will display all three forms (join challenge, login, and register). |
|<h5 id="edit-challenge-entry">4.</h5> | GET, POST | /edit_challenge/&lt;post_id&gt;| GET: After getting to this route a single *challenge* will be loaded allowing for a *host* to change the content of the title or the prompts of this given *challenge*.</br>POST: On submission of the form, the new content will replace the old content from the original *challenge* updating this entity.</br>PostId: This is going to be used to route the challenges so that the correct challenge gets updated. |
|<h5 id="delete-challenge-entry">5.</h5> | POST | /delete_challenge/&lt;post_id&gt; | POST: On submission of this form the *host* will have deleted the relevant *challenge*</br>PostId: This is going to be used to route the challenges so that the correct challenge gets deleted. |
|<h5 id="edit-host-entry">6.</h5> | GET, POST | /edit_host | GET: This will load all of the currently known information for the give *host* onto the page where the logged in user can then update it</br>POST: On submission of the form, the new information will then be used to update the information currently associated with the current *host* |
|<h5 id="result-challenger-entry">7.</h5> | GET | /result/&lt;guid&gt; | GET: This is the *result* page associated with a specific *challenger* after they finish their *challenge*</br>Guid: This is the same guid that is assigned to the *challenger* when they initially join the *challenge* |
|<h5 id="result-joincode-entry">8.</h5> | GET | /aggregate_results/&lt;join_code&gt; | GET: On retrieval of the *result*, the information associated will be used to populate the page with relevant information allowing for both *hosts* and *challengers* to see the relevant rankings and results</br>Join Code: This is the join code of the *challenge* and will be used to query the database to know the exact entity that needs to be pulled to get the relevant information |
|<h5 id="logout-entry">9.</h5> | POST | /logout | POST: In hopes of following MVC the logout button will be implemented as a form to keep separation between the view and the model. On form submission the current *host* will be logged out and will be redirected back to the index page. |
|<h5 id="open-challenge-entry">10.</h5> | POST | /open_challenge/&lt;challenge_id&gt; | POST: This will open a single *challenge* from the *host* perspective now allowing for *challengers* to join the *challenge* to participate</br>ChallengeId: The challenge id is going to be used to route the *challenge* so that the correct thing is opened |
|<h5 id="close-challenge-entry">11.</h5> | POST | /close_challenge/&lt;challenge_id&gt; | POST: This will close a single *challenge* from the *host* perspective disabling *challengers* from being able to join the *challenge* to participate</br>ChallengeId: The challenge id is going to be used to route the *challenge* so that the correct thing is closed | 

### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design 

**Role of the View:** The view is designed to facilitate user interaction with the functionality of our system. Specific to this project, the view is what allows users to initiate the actions in the controller which handle the management of their challenges. The view is also largely responsible for the functionality of the typing test itself in this particular software, as by nature a typing test is little more than an assessment of how quickly and efficiently you can use the user interface.

**How the View is Constructed:** Our view is being written in standard HTML and CSS. As of right now, we have no plans to integrate any external libraries or systems into the software, as our assessment is that the UI is easy enough to accomplish without bulky external libraries. As of iteration 2 there will also be the inclusion of some javascript for page dynamics not able to be accomplished with only HTML and CSS, but for the time being the view does not include any JS. 

In our application specifically we are also setting up the CSS to enable the later addition of additional themes. To enable this all the colors are stored in CSS variables tied to a single class selector that can be changed later on for the implementation of additional themes. The current color theme is referred to as "solarized dark" and consists of five colors designated *primary, subtle, contrast, background,* and *error* 

**Current UI Overview:** Below are the pages included in the current build of the UI, including their screenshots, descriptions, and the use cases which they enable the user to engage with.

**Homepage**

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/HomepageImage1.png)

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/HomepageImage2.png)

*The Homepage:* The homepage is the first page that the average first-time user will see upon using the application. It is an intentionally versatile view layout. The first screenshot is the default view that the player will see, with a minimalist design that highlights the join functionality. If one hovers towards the login button, however, a login/register window will appear to allow for a user to authenticate. **This multi-functional design is intentional,** as one of our non-functional design goals is to minimize page reloads.

*Use Cases:* The homepage UI allows access to the use cases; *Register Host, Log in Host,* and *Join Challenge*

**Create Challenge Page**

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/CreateChallengeImage.png)

*The Create Challenge Page:* The Create Challenge page has only a single major functionality, which is that it allows the user to create a challenge, with a title and a series of prompts that the challengers will have to copy. After entering at least one prompt and a title at the top, the user can post their challenge, and it will open that new challenge for challengers to join.

*Use Cases:* The Create Challenge UI allows access the Use Case *Create Challenge* and *Update Challenge*

**Take Challenge Page:**

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/TakeChallengeImage.png)

*The Take Challenge Page:* The take challenge page will as of the later iterations become the main meat of our application. For now it allows you to type, and displays the first prompt of whatever challenge you've joined, as well as your chosen nickname in the top right corner. The original prompt is displayed in the *subtle* color and the letters you type are overlaid over this in the *primary* color.

*Use Cases:* This page specifically enables access to the *Take Challenge* Use Case.

![](https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2021/TermProject-BadTeam/blob/b3abcb38369178a9f4cbfc6918c007ecf62e36cf/Documents/ViewChallengeImage.png)

*The View Challenges Page:* The view challenges page shows the challenges created by the current user. It displays both open and closed challenges. For open challenges it displays a button to close and the room code. For closed challenges it allows for opening, deleting, editing, and viewing the results of challenges.

*Use Cases:* *View Created Challenges, Initiate Challenge, Delete Challenge,* and *Stop Challenge*

# 3. Progress Report

In iteration one, for the Model, we implemented all the required database models for general functionality, for the Controller, we established basic routing, and for the View, we set up basic pages for user interaction. In terms of the more specific functionalities we have implemented, we have done: creation of host account, creation of challenge, login, viewing challenges, joining a challenge, and the most basic participation in a challenge. In addition, our group feels as though we are effectively using github and think the current process of using Github Issues as an effective way to track work that needs to be done. We are starting to discuss the requirements and the work that we are wanting to get done in iteration 2 which is most notably is going to include the core functionality in participating in a challenge.

In iteration two, for the UI portion, we finished implementing the layout for the different pages that can be accesses by users and hosts - the challenger index page, the host challenges page, the challenger results page, the host's challenge results page, the create a challenge page, the pages for prompts within a challenge. As we advanced through, iterations two, there were a few minor data base model changes - . We were also able to implement typing behaviors and functionalities - allowing a user to type along side with the prompt, highlight the character they inputted the primary color if correct, and if incorrect, highlight the character the contrast color. 

In iteration three, we mainly focused on Unit, Functional, UI, and Selenium testing for our routes, and UI functionality. The Unit tests validate that the correct routes are follow during redirection and check that only hosts can access host routes. The Functional tests describe the manual testing for the functionality of the application - detailing how to access a state of the program and describing how it should be or behave. Additionally, the Selenium tests will simulate inputs to automate functional testing. The UI tests detail the behavior that should occur during user actions like hovering and clicking as well as describing the theming of the application. In combination with testing we added two more themes and update user account functionality, as well as revised the challenge creation page. 

# 4. Testing Plan

**Unit Testing:**

The major modules that we intend to test will will be the routes specific to Challenger and Host application. These modules are the core of our application with distinct roles and functionalities for the user as a challenger or as a host. In this section we also intend to test all of the major routes:  

- /create_challenge - where a host user can create a challenge

- /take_challenge/<guid> - where a challenger can take the challenge based on the specified guid

- /index - which is our main page, where the user can sign in, register, or join a challenge

- /edit_challenge/<post_id> - allows the user to edit the challenge with the correct post_id

- /delete_challenge/<post_id> - allows the user to delete the challenge 

- /edit_host - where a host can edit their profile

- /result/guid?<guid> - the results page for a host to view

- /result/join_code?<join_code> - the results page for a challenger to view

- /logout - where the host can log out

- /open_challenge/<challenge_id> - the host opens the challenge with the challenge_id

- /close_challenge/<challenge_id> - the host closes the challenge with the challenge_id

We will also plan to test the functionalities for logging in a register user (Host) and registering the user if they don't have an account yet. One thing we discussed as a groups is testing any where we have a post request - specifically in the index page as with our design goals we have 3 post requests from that page for ease of access. 

The framework we decided to do for unit testing is the Unit Test framework for python which we will use for testing the aforementioned modules.

**Functional Testing:**

For the functional testing aspect - assuring we fulfill our use cases - we will specify a variety of manual check based sequences in order to demonstrate the application functionality. 

Main sequences that we aim to test will be the *typing behavior, host account operations, creating a challenge, taking a challenge*, and *challenge opening and closing operations*

   - Typing behavior
        - The main idea for testing this behavior is for each challenge we are able to verify that when the user types correct, incorrect, and extra characters that this is being registered and being stored so that it can be packaged into a Result object later.
   - Test the sequence of creating a challenge
        - The main idea for testing the creation of the challenge is to check if after a host logs in if they have the option to create a challenge. If they indicate that they want to create a challenge they should be redirected to a page that allows them to create a challenge. They should then be able to fill out the prompts and name of the challenge and submit it. After submitting they should be able to perform different operations on the challenge such as opening and viewing results.
   - Register, Login and Update Host
        - The main idea for these behaviors is to check that a user is able to register an account using a specific username and password. This newly created host should now, in future uses of our application, be able to use their username and password to sign into their account. Additionally, this host should also be able to change their username and password.
   - Test the sequence of taking a challenge
        - The main idea for testing participating in a challenges is to verify that a user with the correct session id is able to join, is redirected to the first prompt, is able to participate in all the prompts with all typing functionalities, and once finished they will be redirected to a results page where they can view their results.
   - Challenge Opening and Closing Operations
        - The main idea for this testing sequence is to verify the correct application behavior for opening and closing a challenge. After the creation of a challenge it should be in an unjoinable state, if the host were to open the challenge it should now be in a joinable state. Furthermore, after any period of time the host should be able to close the challenge and it should once again be in an unjoinable state.

**UI Testing:**

Similar to Functional testing we concluded the best way to test the UI would be through manual testing of described behavioral sequences. We decided that the UI tests would cover: on hover and on click events, general and situational color scheme and layouts, and states for the open and closed challenges in the Host's main page. 

   - CSS on hover and on click events
        - The main goal with testing these events is to ensure the correct behavior with hovering and clicking certain elements, one of our design principles is to elevate user ease of access which we implemented with hidden forms that fade in on hover.
   - Correct color scheme for the layout
        - The main goal for testing this is to check that we are utilizing the correct colors for different sections of our application. We decided on a solarized dark theme which specified the primary, subtle, contrast, background, and error colors which will be implemented by certain elements within our application depending on their behavior and role within the layout. 
   - Input validation error should show error state
        - The main goal for testing here is to verify that if a user inputs an incorrect entry (letter in challenges, code in index) the offending character(s) will be highlighted with the error color - in the solarized dark theme, it is a red-orange.
   - Check for correct states for open and close test states (colors, buttons)
        - The main goal for testing these states is to check if when a challenge is active the corresponding colors and arrangement of buttons are correct as well as the same check for if the challenge is closed, this will take place in the /view_challenges page.

**Special Notes:**

We briefly expressed our interest in using Selenium for testing however we don't have enough experience with it to justify choosing to use it at this moment but it is a point of interest for our team to research and potentially use within Iteration 3.
