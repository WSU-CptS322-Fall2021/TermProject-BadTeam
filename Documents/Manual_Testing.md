- Create A Challenge
- Opening A Challenge
- Taking a Challenge
- Typing Behavior
- Closing A Challenge

  - In the text editor for the prompt, while in the middle of a word, type a character other than that you see in the underlying prompt
  - Confirm that the correct underlying character turned the error color and that you do not see the character you typed. You should be able to continue typing or backspace. 
- Type an incorrect character at the end of the word
  - In the text editor for the prompt, while at the end of a word, type a character other than that you see in the underlying prompt
  - Confirm that the character you typed was inserted into the underlying text is in the error color. You will not be able to proceed unless you press space.
