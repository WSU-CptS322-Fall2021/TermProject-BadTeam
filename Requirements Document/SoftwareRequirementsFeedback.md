# Project Requirements Feedback

## Requirements Specification
Overall, really solid work. Only real issue (which is minor) is with actions. Remember that actions are a two way street. If a user indicates they want to do something like edit information, the software must provide them with a way to fill out that information.
You guys took on the work of tackling a harder project, and your use cases covered pretty much every base. Great work!

## User Interface
Fantastic mock-ups. It seems you have a very clear idea of how things should be laid out.
